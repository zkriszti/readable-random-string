# Readable Random String Generator (RRSG)

Again a small "just for fun & practice" project. It generates easily memorizeable random strings of a desired length between 3 and 14 characters.

## The problem addressed

...is that many password-generators will just leave you with an unmemorizable bunch of characters spit out. RRSG, however, will create strings with alternating layout of consonants and vowels of the English alphabet. With this, you just put a number to the end, _et voil√°_ , here you have a secure password. (Remember: the best passwords are not the most difficult ones but those that are long enough & the user is still willing to memorize).
